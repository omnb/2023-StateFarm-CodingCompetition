# Feedback

1. Your team: Internship Express
2. Name of each individual participating: Om Badhe and Logan Cheng
3. How many unit tests were you able to pass? Passed every test case
4. Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.
    - Example One - We were able to pass the last test case even with the complications
    - Example Two - Changed the field path for the .json files so the files were readable. Before it was going in a data directory that didn't exist before being updated. So I changed it to go into the round one folder and then read the files.

5. Any feedback for the coding competition? Things you would like to see in future events? I think the event was great and the quick updates on any problems was amazing.
